# Ruby Programs

Here are a bunch of simple ruby programs that might help beginners, The repository will keep expanding as I progress with Ruby myself.

## How to run

### Debian/Ubuntu

Step 1: In terminal type 'ruby -v' to check your version and make sure ruby is installed. If it is, skip to step 3.

Step 2: If ruby is not installed follow [these](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) steps.

Step 3: cd into the directory where programs have been downloaded

Step 4: type ```ruby [filename.rb] ``` to execute.

### Windows

Step 1: Check if Ruby is installed 
	On the 32 bit vs 64 bit part:
	ruby -e "puts 1.size"
	The 32 bit version would yield 4, the 64 bit version 8. (This is the size of a FixNum in bytes.)

Step 2: If ruby is not installed follow [these](http://rubyinstaller.org/) steps.

Step 3: cd into the directory where programs have been downloaded

Step 4: type ```ruby [filename.rb] ``` to execute.
